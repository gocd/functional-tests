  body: High performant source reloader
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: This class acts as Rack middleware.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: What makes it especially suited for use in a production environment is that
    any file will only be checked once and there will only be made one system call
    stat(2).
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Please note that this will not reload files in the background, it does so
    only when actively called.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: It is performing a check/reload cycle at the start of every request, but also
    respects a cool down time, during which nothing will be done.
