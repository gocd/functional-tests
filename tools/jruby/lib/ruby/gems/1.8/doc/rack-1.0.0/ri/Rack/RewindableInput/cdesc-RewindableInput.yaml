comment: 
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Class which can make any IO object rewindable, including non-rewindable ones.
    It does this by buffering the data into a tempfile, which is rewindable.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: rack.input is required to be rewindable, so if your input stream IO is non-rewindable
    by nature (e.g. a pipe or a socket) then you can wrap it in an object of this
    class to easily make it rewindable.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: 'Don''t forget to call #close when you''re done. This frees up temporary resources
    that RewindableInput uses, though it does <b>not</b> close the original IO object.'
